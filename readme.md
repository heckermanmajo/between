Read the main.lua file.

## Story

You are clipped into another dimension that looks like the backrooms, but is actually 
a different place: A harvesting field for souls created by a big demon.

But since all demons need to play by gods' rules, you have to have a chance to escape.

So you can find supplies and if you manage your resources correctly, you can escape.
